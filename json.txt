see first you hold element in script

let fname=document.getElementById("fname").value; //this gives value inputed by user
let lname=document.getElementById("lname").value; //this gives value inputed by user
let obj={
    fname: fname;//first fname is key and second fname is variable;
    lname: lname;//first lname is key and second lname is variable;
}
let arr=[];
arr.push(obj);

// arr=[{fname: ABC,lname:CBA},{fname:EFG,lname:GFE}];
//here the fname is the key of the object but now see it is not related to either the form or the variable of js, 
// to prove it we can write the below code as well and it will work
let fname1=document.getElementById("fname").value; //this gives value inputed by user
let lname1=document.getElementById("lname").value; //this gives value inputed by user
let obj={
    fname2: fname1;//first fname is key and second fname is variable;
    lname2: lname1;//first lname is key and second lname is variable;
}
let arr=[];
arr.push(obj);
